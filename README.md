This movie is offered a place in the Marvel Cinematic Universe by the Time Variance Authority, but instead recruits a variant of Wolverine to save his universe from extinction. The movie was released **July 26,2024**. For me this song is full of actions because the main
goal of this movie is to save the universe from the extinction. And I love it sometimes there's an error output but so far you will not almost notice if you really gonna focus on its storyline. And it is stil recommended for the people who loves an action movies like this one.

Miles Morales catapults across the multiverse, where he encounters a team of Spider-People charged with protecting its very existence. When the heroes clash on how to handle a new threat, Miles must redefine what it means to be a hero. The movie was released **June 2, 2023** 
. For me this movie is all about the multiverse to defeat "**the spot**". A very powerful enemy that it can manipulate time, space and gravity and **the spot** willing to destroy the whole universe and to extinc the humans, and also to defeat miles morales which he is the main
character in the movie. For me I'd recommend this movie for the person who loves fantasy&actions which mean a cartoon but action movie. The quality is good you are gonna enjoy watching it. And the part 2 will gonna released on *2025** and there's no exact month to be released. But
it is estimated to be released on **2025**, by not going past than year **2025**.

Wave to earth is a South Korean indie rock band. The band currently consists of lead vocalist and guitarist Kim Daniel, drummer Shin Donggyu, and bassist Cha Soonjong. Since their formation in 2019, the band has released 2 studio albums. For me Wave to earth's song is about
for the people who has a is struggling in love, the people who can't admit his/her feelings on someone else. And this song can relate many people. This song is like a meditation and a very calming song. And it reliefs my stress somehow. And for me my favorite song to wave to earth is the
"**ride**". This song is pretty good especially when you wake up in the morning and you eat your breakfast while listening to this song.

This is takayoshi, an underrated song writer based on my thoughts. His songs is all about for person who has going through something: Stress, problems or love life. If you are interested to his music I think for me it would be quite dramatic but overall he is so good.
And plus, I don't know when did he start to make his first song because he is so underrate and not that famous. But for me I think his first song is "on your mind", and I love it.
